## Google Sheets Template Structure

Create a Google Sheet with the following columns:

### Column Headers:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Use Case #** | Sequential number (1-25) |
| **Regulation** | EU AI Act / UK AI Act / MAS |
| **System Name** | Name of the AI system |
| **Use Case Description** | Brief description of what the system does |
| **Expected Risk Tier** | What risk tier we expect (Prohibited/High-risk/Limited-risk/Minimal-risk for EU; Frontier/High-Risk/Medium-Risk/Low-Risk for UK; Critical/High/Medium/Low for MAS) |
| **Actual Risk Tier** | What the LLM actually generated |
| **Match?** | Yes/No - Does actual match expected? |
| **Compliance Status** | Compliant / Partially compliant / Non-compliant |
| **Key Triggers** | What specific answers triggered this risk tier (e.g., "q4: credit_scoring", "q5: social_scoring") |
| **Notes** | Any observations or discrepancies |

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Fill out all 9 EU AI Act use cases
- [ ] Fill out all 8 UK AI Act use cases
- [ ] Fill out all 8 MAS use cases
- [ ] Log each result in Google Sheets immediately after submission
- [ ] Compare Expected vs Actual risk tiers
- [ ] Note any discrepancies or unexpected results
- [ ] Document any patterns observed (e.g., LLM consistently over/under-classifying certain types)
- [ ] Share Google Sheet with manager for review

---

## Notes for Manager

This testing exercise will help us:
1. **Validate LLM accuracy** - How well does the LLM classify risk tiers?
2. **Identify edge cases** - Are there scenarios where the LLM misclassifies?
3. **Improve prompts** - Use findings to refine the LLM prompts if needed
4. **Document behavior** - Create a reference guide for expected risk classifications

**Expected Completion Time:** 2-3 hours for all 25 use cases

**Deliverable:** Google Sheet with all 25 test cases and results
